<h1>Counting Total Organizations from a text file mbox</h1>

<p>In this Project we have used sqllite3 libraries and made this on jupyter notebook, at first we have imported all the essential libraries, than we have created a database <b>"mail_box"</b>
in that database we have created a table called <b>"Counts"</b> with collumn names as - <b>"org" and "count"</b>.</p>

<p>Now, to calculate the organisations in the text file mobox we have created a logic in which the text file will be read and the organisation name will be inputed into the org collumn and the
count will be updated into the count collumn.</p>

<p>After, inputing the values into the Counts table, this will be printed in the form of descending order by their count valus.</p>
